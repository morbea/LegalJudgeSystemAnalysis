Due to the complexity of the task and the fact that HeBERT is primarily designed for sentiment analysis, we determined that 6,000 examples would provide a solid foundation for the model. Additionally, throughout the process, we encountered a challenging parsing issue. To address this, we utilized an API for part of the tagging task, while the remaining tags were applied manually by us"
